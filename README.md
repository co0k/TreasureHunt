App for the course Software Engineering and Projectmanagment.
This App consists of a game similar to geocaching, but instead of searching and placing caches, everything will be virtually handled. The purpose is to find virtually treasures, that are generated by a server. these treasures can contain several things like quizzes(most likely) achievements, coupons and other stuff.
